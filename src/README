This directory contains: 

maurer_openmp/ : OpenMP implementation of maurer's Feature Tranformation (FT). 
		It takes the raw volume that has already been detected face boundaries 
		and assigned masks, then generates the FT (Closet Feature Voxel Transformation) 
		for the raw volume.

maurer_gpu/ : GPU Accelerated solution for Feature Transformation (FT).

exhaustive_ft/ : This version of Closet Feature Voxel Transformation can be used as a 
		reference solution.

distance_transformation_openmp/ : post stage of Closet Feature Voxel Transformation. It takes FT 
		generated by MAURER or Danielsson and returns back the FINAL distance transformation
		based on different transformation schemes (center-to-center or center-to-face).

distance_transformation_gpu/ : GPU Accelerated solution for distance transformation
